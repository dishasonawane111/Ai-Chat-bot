# AI Bot with Advance Memory Utilization

An interactive AI-powered chatbot with voice capabilities that listens to user queries and responds in the same language. Choose between two unique bot personas—a **Rude Banker** and a **Humble Actor**—each with its own distinct personality and backstory. This project demonstrates how to integrate Speech-to-Text (using OpenAI's Whisper API), Natural Language Processing (using OpenAI's Chat API), and Text-to-Speech (using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API) into one complete application.

## Features

- **Dual Bot Personas:**  
  - **Rude Banker:** A sarcastic and dismissive banker who only answers banking-related queries.
  - **Humble Actor:** A kind and thoughtful actor who shares personal experiences and offers life advice.
- **Multilingual Support:**  
  Bots detect the language of the user's input and reply in the same language.
- **Voice Input & Output:**  
  - **Speech-to-Text:** Convert spoken queries into text using the Whisper API.
  - **Text-to-Speech:** Convert bot responses into audio using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.
- **Web-Based Chat Interface:**  
  A modern, responsive UI built with React that mimics the look and feel of popular chat applications.
- **Session Memory:**  
  Conversation history is maintained during a session for context-aware responses.
- **Customizable Avatars and Team Info:**  
  A sidebar displays a hackathon logo and team member names, adding a personal touch to the app.
